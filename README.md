# JFallback

Run modern java code on java8

### Why?

Because I cannot expect users to be able to install anything newer than java8, 
and I want to be able to run java11 code on their systems.

This was initially in https://github.com/Fox2Code/FoxLoader

You probably don't need this library if you can control which runtime is used.

### Compatibility

Note: JFallback currently only support up to java11 code.

If something doesn't work, open an issue, I'll probs fix it.
